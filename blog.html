        <h3 class="font-semibold text-3xl">Q1: What is DOM? What is the purpuse of DOM? </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-xl"> <span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span>DOM stands for Document Object Model in its entire form. It is a web documentation programming interface system. It enables dynamic access to and manipulation of the web page's content and structure. To construct dynamic, interactive online applications, JavaScript programming makes extensive use of it. The primary function of the DOM is to offer a dynamically controllable, structured representation of web documents. Every node in the tree corresponds to an element, property, or chunk of text in the web document, which is how the DOM is represented. Developers have the ability to instantly change the look, feel, and content of a web page by leveraging the power of changing the properties and methods of these nodes. It aids web designers in producing interactive web sites that react to user input. Events are what this system refers to as these user actions. The user experience can be improved by how we handle these events.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-3xl">Q2: How to select element in DOM? </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-xl"> <span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span>getElementsByTagName(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementById(), querySelector(), querySelectorAll()</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-3xl">Q3: What is event buble? </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-xl"> <span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span> The Document Object Model has a unique method called Event Bubble (DOM). It enables events to "bubble up" or spread from the target element to its ancestors in the DOM tree until they reach the document's root. In this strategy, if an event is triggered on an element, it can potentially also trigger on all of its parent elements unless one of the parent elements prevents the event from spreading. The ability to access the parent events of a web page's DOM architecture makes event bubbling crucial. By doing this, we can efficiently access and edit higher level items. Moreover, "stopImmediatePropagation()" or "stopPropagation()" methods can be used to halt unwanted propagation.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-3xl">Q1: What is call break function? How does it work? </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-xl"> <span class="font-semibold">Ans:</span>Callback functions in JavaScript are distinct functions that are used as arguments in other functions. The parent function or higher level function calls this callback function, which runs following the completion of the parent function. The majority of asynchronous programming is handled through callback functions in event-driven programming languages like JavaScript. Typically, when making an asynchronous server request using an object, we can supply a callback function that will be called when the server returns object data.</p>
